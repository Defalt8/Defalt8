# Welcome

Hello there. Welcome to my github. I don't know if you've noticed but most of my repos are private. Yes. It is because most of them are legacy and not worth your time. But know that I've been upto a lot these past years. 

You can check out these repos:

- [axl](https://github.com/Defalt8/axl) -- General purpose minimal C++ library. 
- [glfl](https://github.com/Defalt8/glfl) -- A super fast and lightweight OpenGL function loader in pure C++.
- [G2](https://github.com/Defalt8/g2) -- A new 2D game engine using OpenGL. Migrating code from previous game engine code (axl.ge).
